# Fitness App Project Brief ## Overview I want to build a fitness app that helps me keep track of everything I do at the gym **super easily** — all from the palm of my hand. I don’t know much about the gym or supplements, protein powders, or any of that stuff. The app should: - Look **very nice** and have a **simple, easy-to-use** interface - Have a **ComfyUI feel** (comfortable, clean, minimalistic, and user-friendly) - Allow me to find the name of an exercise if I don’t know it and input how many reps I do - Make tracking my workouts fast and effortless --- ## Checklist / Features to Build ### User Interface - Clean, modern, and minimal design with a comfy and inviting feel - Simple navigation with clear buttons and icons - Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices (iOS and Android) - Dark mode and light mode options (optional but desirable) ### User Experience - Easy onboarding/introduction to the app - Searchable exercise database with name, description, and maybe images or short videos - Ability to add custom exercises manually if not found in the database - Simple input fields for reps, sets, weight, and notes for each exercise - Quick add buttons for common exercises or favorites ### Core Functionalities - Workout logging per session with timestamps - History of past workouts with filtering options (date, exercise, etc.) - Summary statistics (e.g., total volume lifted, progress charts) - Option to create and save workout routines/plans - Ability to edit or delete workout entries easily ### Additional Features (Nice to Have) - Basic info/help about common gym terms or supplements (optional) - Integration with phone sensors or wearables for tracking (optional/future) - Export workout data as CSV or shareable summary - Notifications/reminders for workout days or goals ### Technical Details (for AI/developer) - Cross-platform app (React Native, Flutter, or native iOS/Android) - Backend for storing user data securely (Firebase, Supabase, or custom API) - Fast search functionality for exercises - User authentication (email/social login) or simple guest mode - Scalable architecture to add new features easily later on --- ## Summary I want an app that takes the complexity out of tracking workouts, especially since I don’t know much about gym exercises or supplements. The app should be approachable, visually appealing, and let me easily log everything I do, including looking up exercises and entering reps. --- *This brief can be given to an AI assistant or developer to start building the app.* Sample UI Design Concept 1. Home Screen (Workout Dashboard) Top: Greeting (e.g., "Hey, Ethan! Ready to workout?") Middle: Big, prominent button: "Start New Workout" Below: Quick links/buttons to: "Log Exercise" "View History" "Favorites" Footer: Simple bottom navigation with icons: Home / Search / Profile 2. Exercise Search & Add Screen Search bar at top: "Find an exercise..." List of exercises below with thumbnails (simple icons or photos) Tap an exercise to open detail view: Exercise name Brief description Input fields: Sets, Reps, Weight (optional), Notes Button: "Add to Workout" 3.
